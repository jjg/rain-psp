# RAIN PSP Hardware

RAIN PSP consists of off-the-shelf electronics combined with 3D printable chassis components as well as some custom electronics.

The current design revolves around the [Pine64 Clusterboard](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Clusterboard).  This board provides a network of seven four-core ARM SoCs and Gigabit Ethernet interconnect.  An additional [PINE A64-LTS](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PINE_A64-LTS/SOPine) SBC serves as the "front-end" to the cluster, providing the user with an environment to interact with the cluster, develop applcations and serve as a terminal for the individual nodes in the cluster.

In addition to the computational components, peripherals such as keyboard, display, power supply, etc. are documented under this directory.
