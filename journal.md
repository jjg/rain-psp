# RAIN PSP Development Journal

## 10022021

Initial creation of new repository specific to the PSP project.  I'm still going to try and recover the original documentation, but I don't want to waste time hunting for that which I could spend working on something new.

Now that I have a printer large enough to print the entire case I've been imagining, let's take a whack at that.

What parts?

* Case bottom
* Case top
* Display bottom
* Display top
* Keyboard 

It might make sense to model the parts that go inside the thing:

* Clusterboard
* PINE A64
* Fans
* Power supply/battery
