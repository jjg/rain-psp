# RAIN PSP Software

This is where the base operating system image will live.  I'm still trying to figure out exactly how to put that together as there will be distinct images for cluster nodes vs. the front-end, and ideally the cluster node images will require zero configuration.

In addition to the base O/S, the front-end image will include development and management tools for the system.

Firmware for custom hardware may live here as well, but I'm not 100% sure about that yet.
